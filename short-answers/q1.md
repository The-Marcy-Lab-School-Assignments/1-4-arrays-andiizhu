# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer

The reason why `favoriteLocations` changed but `name` was because of the functions that they were in. In the `changeName` function, the code block is missing a return that will output a value. As a result, the `name` contains the value of "tom". but it's not being outputed as a value. On the other hand, in the `favoriteLocations` function, the body of the code is using the array method `.unshift` which adds the value in the front of the array. This code alters the array because arrays are passed by reference and are mutable.

# Teacher Feedback

favoriteLocations was changed because arrays pass references that can be mutated, while name was not changed because it's an immutable string.
