# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer

The reason why `favoriteLocations` changed but `name` was not was because of the variable was reference inside of the function. In the `changeName` function, the body of the cody should refer to the variable `name` equal to `nameToChange`. Then when invoking the function, the argument should be tom resulting in `changeName("tom")`.

# Teacher Feedback
favoriteLocations was changed because arrays pass references that can be mutated, while name was not changed because it's an immutable string.
